# About project
The goal of the project that we are trying to implement is to help for needy children and have a problem with disabilities, which is one of the most pressing problems at the moment. Financial support for low-income, needy and health-conscious people (mainly children) or children with learning disabilities.
Currently, many people who do not know where to turn for help on the Internet, or in some cases disseminate false information, lack of unconfirmed data or transparency, reduce the number of donors. The project that we want to create includes a website, mobile applications and telegram bots that can provide reliable information to those who want to reach out and help the needy people of the world. In the future, we plan to integrate blockchain technology into this system.
